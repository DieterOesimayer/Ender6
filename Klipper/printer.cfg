# This file contains common pin mappings for the BigTreeTech SKR 2.
# To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# STM32F407 with a "32KiB bootloader".

# The "make flash" command does not work on the SKR 2. Instead,
# after running "make", copy the generated "out/klipper.bin" file to a
# file named "firmware.bin" on an SD card and then restart the SKR 2
# with that SD card.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
#
# Note: The initial revision of this board has a flaw that can cause
# damage to itself and other boards. Be sure to verify the board is
# not impacted by this flaw before using it.
